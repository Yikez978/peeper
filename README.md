peeper
======

peeper is designed to parse Nessus reports that detect webservers,
and take screen shots of the parsed report.

What you need
-------------

* PhantomJS
* X11 Fonts to render text with PhantomJS
* Python

Who thought of this first?
--------------------------
That would be [Tim Tomes(@LaNMaSter53)][1]), I've just taken the idea
and made it very specific to Nessus reports. If you want to see his 
code, check it out [here][2].
